          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>Paws for a Cause is a youth‑led nonprofit founded on July 16, 2025, by a group of high school juniors in Okemos, Michigan, after witnessing firsthand the struggles animals face both locally and in other parts of the world we’ve traveled. Moved by what we saw, we created this organization to promote animal adoption, fostering, education, community outreach, youth involvement, and fundraising for critical medical care. From welfare to outreach, every integral part of the organization is led by teens. Our mission is to make animal welfare a priority in modern society and to give young people a voice in that change. Whether we’re raising funds for animals, hosting adoption events, or educating peers, we are committed to improving animal lives—one paw at a time.</p>

          <h1>Our Work</h1>
          <p>At Paws for a Cause, we bring together caring neighbors, volunteers, and local businesses to help animals who need a second chance. We organize fun community events and simple awareness campaigns to shine a spotlight on pets who are often overlooked. Through these efforts, we raise funds for adoptions, support new pet owners, strengthen shelters, and cover life‑saving surgeries. By partnering with local sponsors and inviting everyone to join our mission, we build a welcoming network of animal lovers. Together, we can make our community a kinder place and give every animal a safe, loving home.</p>

        <p>
          Paws for a Cause is a youth-led nonprofit founded on July 16, 2025, by a group of high school juniors in Okemos, Michigan, after witnessing firsthand the struggles animals face both locally and in other parts of the world we’ve traveled. Moved by what we saw, we created this organization to promote animal adoption, fostering, education, community outreach, youth involvement, and fundraising for critical medical care. From welfare to outreach, every integral part of the organization is led by teens. Our mission is to make animal welfare a priority in modern society and to give young people a voice in that change. Whether we’re raising funds for animals, hosting adoption events, or educating peers, we are committed to improving animal lives—one paw at a time.
